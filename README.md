## NOtes
Analyze synergy here, network here is defining more quanitity over quality
aggregate over time
defining time as number of games you have played, this could define how much you have scored. Ratio of GP to Points. Quality of player rather than quantity of the player

normalize the data

how many played, when you play, how you played
